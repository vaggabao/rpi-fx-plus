Version 1.0.0
Dec. 03, 2015 1:21 AM

1. Search pagination
2. Load more on search
3. Removed Save of search results
4. Added gallery for images took using the pi camera
5. Moved API service inside the Web application

NOTE:

-- Run python service inside the Web App directory (already included inside fx-plus directory in this build). This is to allow the Web Application to access the images being saved when printing images took by the pi camera.
-- No changes made on pistreaming
-- Keep a copy of the previous fx-plus-service for backup purposes. If the python service won't start, try replacing the env directory in this build with the env of the previous build.
